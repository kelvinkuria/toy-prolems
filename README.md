# Grade Calculator

## Overview

This simple JavaScript program calculates a student's grade based on user-input marks. The program prompts the user to enter the student's marks (between 0 and 100) and then determines the corresponding grade.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. When prompted, enter the student's marks.

3. The program will display the calculated grade in an alert.

## Code Structure

The main functionality is encapsulated in the `calculateGrade` function defined in the `index.js` file. The function performs the following steps:

- Prompts the user for input.
- Converts the input to a number and validates it.
- Determines the grade based on the input marks.
- Displays the calculated grade using an alert.

## How to Run

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grade-calculator.git



# Speed Checker Program

This simple JavaScript program checks the speed of a car and determines the demerit points based on the specified rules. If the speed is below the speed limit, it prints "Ok." Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit, it assigns one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the program prints "License suspended."

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a JavaScript environment to run the program.
2. Copy the provided JavaScript code into a file (e.g., `speedChecker.js`).
3. Run the script in your JavaScript environment, providing the speed of the car as input.
